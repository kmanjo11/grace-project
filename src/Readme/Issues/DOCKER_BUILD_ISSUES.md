# Grace Project - Docker and Build Issues

## Current State

### Docker Architecture
- Multi-container setup with services:
  - Frontend (React/TypeScript)
  - Backend (FastAPI)
  - Mango V3 Service
  - Database (PostgreSQL)
  - Redis (Caching/Message Broker)
  - Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

### Build System
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python 3.10+ with Poetry for dependency management
- Containerization: Docker Compose for local development

## Known Issues

### 1. Frontend Build Issues
- **Next.js Configuration**: Mismatch between development and production builds
- **Environment Variables**: Inconsistent loading between Docker and local development
- **Hot Reload**: Not working consistently in Docker

### 2. Backend Service Dependencies
- **Python Version**: Inconsistent Python versions across team members
- **Native Dependencies**: Issues with building Python packages with C extensions
- **Poetry Lock File**: Not consistently updated across the team

### 3. Mango V3 Integration
- **Solana RPC Connection**: Timeout issues during container startup
- **Wallet Initialization**: Private key handling in containerized environment
- **Service Discovery**: Mango service not always discoverable by other containers

### 4. Database Management
- **Migrations**: Manual migration steps required after schema changes
- **Data Persistence**: Volume mounting issues on Windows hosts
- **Backup/Restore**: No automated backup solution in place

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Build Times**: Slow builds due to inefficient layer caching
- **Test Environment**: Inconsistent test environments between local and CI
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment steps required

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Standardize Development Environment**
   - Create a `.devcontainer` configuration
   - Document exact Python/Node.js versions
   - Use Docker's build cache effectively

2. **Improve Build Process**
   - Implement multi-stage builds
   - Optimize Dockerfile layers
   - Add health checks for all services

3. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Document all environment variables
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Include common error messages and solutions

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Move to Kubernetes for better orchestration
   - Implement proper secrets management
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automate testing and deployment
   - Implement blue/green deployments
   - Add performance testing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Errors
1. **Container Failing to Start**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs <service_name>
   docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
   ```

2. **Dependency Issues**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild dependencies
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   
   # Reinstall Python dependencies
   docker-compose exec backend poetry install
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check database status
   docker-compose exec db pg_isready
   
   # Reset database
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Monitoring and Logs
- Access container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Monitor resource usage: `docker stats`
- Check service health: `docker-compose ps`

## Next Steps
1. Implement the immediate fixes
2. Set up monitoring
3. Document the deployment process
4. Schedule regular maintenance
