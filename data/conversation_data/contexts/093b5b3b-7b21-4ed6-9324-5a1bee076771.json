Unlike typical cryptocurrencies which can be quite volatile, UST is designed to be pegged closely to USD, making it more stable and suitable for transactions where price stability is important. TerraUSD is part of the Terra blockchain platform, which uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payment systems.\n\nIf you're interested in trading or learning more about how it works, let me know how I can help further!",
